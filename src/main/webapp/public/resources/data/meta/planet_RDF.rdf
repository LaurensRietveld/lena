particular post, he shoots straight at the business community
revealing "Opportunity Cost" containment as the invisible driver
behind the business aspects of any market inflection.</p>
<p>Remember, the Web isn't ubiquitous because its users mastered
the mechanics and virtues of HTML and/or HTTP. Web ubiquity is a
function of the opportunity cost of not being on the Web, courtesy
of the network effects of hyperlinked documents -- i.e., the
instant gratification of traversing documents on the Web via a
single click action. In similar fashion, the Linked Data Web's
ubiquity will simply come down to the opportunity cost of not being
"inside the Web", courtesy of the network effects of hyperlinked
entities (documents, people, music, books, and other "Things").</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from Orri's post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Every time there is a major shift in technology, this
shift needs to be motivated by addressing a new class of problem.
This means doing something that could not be done before. The last
time this happened was when the relational database became the
dominant IT technology. At that time, the questions involved
putting the enterprise in the database and building a cluster of
line of business applications around the database. The argument for
the <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relational_database_management_system"
id="link-id113779e8" name="link-id113779e8">RDBMS</a> was that you
did not have to constrain the set of queries that might later be
made, when designing the database. In other words, it was making
things more ad hoc. This was opposed then on grounds of being less
efficient than the hierarchical and network databases which the
relational eventually replaced.</cite> <cite>Today, the point of
the Data Web is that you do not have to constrain what your data
can join or integrate with, when you design your database. The
counter-argument is that this is slow and geeky and not scalable.
See the similarity?</cite> <cite>A difference is that we are not
specifically aiming at replacing the RDBMS. In fact, if you know
exactly what you will query and have a well defined workload, a
relational representation optimized for the workload will give you
about 10x the performance of the equivalent RDF warehouse. OLTP
remains a relational-only domain.</cite> <cite>However, when we are
talking about doing queries and analytics against the Web, or even
against more than a handful of relational systems, the things which
make RDBMS good become problematic.</cite></p>

</blockquote>
<p>If we think about Web 1.0 as a period where the distinguishing
noun was: "Author", and Web 2.0 the noun: "Journalist", we should
be able to see that what comes next is the noun: "Analyst". This
new generation analyst would be equipped with de-referencable Web
Identity courtesy of their Person <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entity" id="link-id111ab7d0" name=
"link-id111ab7d0">Entity</a> <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" id=
"link-id10f23220" name="link-id10f23220">URI</a>. The analyst's URI
would also be the critical component of Web based low cost
attribution ecosystem; one that ultimately turns the URI into the
analyst's brand emblem / imprint.</p>

on the business value. His post is titled: <a href=
"http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/?id=1459" id=
"link-id1109d340" name="link-id1109d340">State of the Semantic Web
(Part 1) - Sociology, Business, and Messaging</a>.
<p>Typically, Orri's post are targeted at the hard core RDF and
<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SQL" id="link-id115e2818"
name="link-id115e2818">SQL</a> DBMS audiences, but in this
particular post, he shoots straight at the business community
revealing "Opportunity Cost" containment as the invisible driver
behind the business aspects of any market inflection.</p>
<p>Remember, the Web isn't ubiquitous because its users mastered
the mechanics and virtues of HTML and/or HTTP. Web ubiquity is a
function of the opportunity cost of not being on the Web, courtesy
of the network effects of hyperlinked documents -- i.e., the
instant gratification of traversing documents on the Web via a
single click action. In similar fashion, the Linked Data Web's
ubiquity will simply come down to the opportunity cost of not being
"inside the Web", courtesy of the network effects of hyperlinked
entities (documents, people, music, books, and other "Things").</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from Orri's post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Every time there is a major shift in technology, this
shift needs to be motivated by addressing a new class of problem.
This means doing something that could not be done before. The last
time this happened was when the relational database became the
dominant IT technology. At that time, the questions involved
putting the enterprise in the database and building a cluster of
line of business applications around the database. The argument for
the <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relational_database_management_system"
id="link-id113779e8" name="link-id113779e8">RDBMS</a> was that you
did not have to constrain the set of queries that might later be
made, when designing the database. In other words, it was making
things more ad hoc. This was opposed then on grounds of being less
efficient than the hierarchical and network databases which the
relational eventually replaced.</cite> <cite>Today, the point of
the Data Web is that you do not have to constrain what your data
can join or integrate with, when you design your database. The
counter-argument is that this is slow and geeky and not scalable.
See the similarity?</cite> <cite>A difference is that we are not
specifically aiming at replacing the RDBMS. In fact, if you know
exactly what you will query and have a well defined workload, a
relational representation optimized for the workload will give you
about 10x the performance of the equivalent RDF warehouse. OLTP
remains a relational-only domain.</cite> <cite>However, when we are
talking about doing queries and analytics against the Web, or even
against more than a handful of relational systems, the things which
make RDBMS good become problematic.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we think about Web 1.0 as a period where the distinguishing
noun was: "Author", and Web 2.0 the noun: "Journalist", we should
be able to see that what comes next is the noun: "Analyst". This
new generation analyst would be equipped with de-referencable Web
Identity courtesy of their Person <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entity" id="link-id111ab7d0" name=
"link-id111ab7d0">Entity</a> <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" id=
"link-id10f23220" name="link-id10f23220">URI</a>. The analyst's URI
would also be the critical component of Web based low cost
attribution ecosystem; one that ultimately turns the URI into the
analyst's brand emblem / imprint.</p>

In this post I want to provide a simple no-hassles HOWTO guide for

<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/PHP" id="link-id12736b88"
name="link-id12736b88">PHP</a> 3.5 runtime.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of PHP Runtime Hosting?</h3>
<p>Simple, this means that like <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apache" id="link-id111ca408" name=
"link-id111ca408">Apache</a>, Virtuoso is a bona-fide <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Wide_Web">Web</a> <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Application_server" id=
"link-id110d2aa8" name="link-id110d2aa8">Application Server</a> for
an PHP application. Unlike Apache, Virtuoso is also the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a DBMS Engine (<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SQL" id=
"link-id10f43d78" name="link-id10f43d78">SQL</a>, XML, RDF, and
unstructured Text) that is accessible via industry standard
interfaces (solely)</li>
<li>a Virtual DBMS or Master <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Data">Data</a> Manager (MDM) for
heterogeneous and distributed SQL, XML, RDF, unstructured Text
based data sources</li>

<li>an <a href=
"http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/public/search.vspx?blogid=127&amp;q=rdf%20middleware&amp;type=text&amp;output=html"
id="link-id1116aad8" name="link-id1116aad8">RDF Middleware</a>
solution for RDF-zation of non RDF resources across the Web and
enterprise Intranets and/or Extranets (in the form of Cartridges
for SOA &amp; REST Servers and RDF Views (Semantic Covers) over SQL
and/or XML data sources)</li>
<li>an RDF <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linked_Data" id=
"link-id10fbe088" name="link-id10fbe088">Linked Data</a> Server
(meaning it can deploy RDF Linked Data)</li>
</ul>
<p>As result of the above, when you deploy a PHP application using
Virtuoso, you inherit the following benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of PHP-<a href="http://www.iodbc.org" id="link-id1159e070"
name="link-id1159e070">iODBC</a> for in-process communication with
Virtuoso</li>

<li>Easy generation of RDF Linked Data from the SQL schemas of PHP
applications</li>
<li>Easy deployment of RDF Linked Data</li>
<li>Less <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/LAMP_stack" id=
"link-id1179dff0" name="link-id1179dff0">LAMP</a> monoculture
(*there is no such thing as virtuous monoculture*) when dealing
with PHP based Web applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>As indicated in prior posts, producing RDF Linked Data from the
existing Web, where a lot of content is deployed by PHP based
content managers, should simply come down to RDF Views over the SQL
Schemas and deployment / publishing of the RDF Views in RDF Linked
data form. In a nutshell, this is what Virtuoso delivers via its
PHP runtime hosting and pre packaged VADs (Virtuoso Application
Distribution packages) for popular PHP based applications such as:
phpBB3, <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drupal" id=
"link-id111ff1c0" name="link-id111ff1c0">Drupal</a>, <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/WordPress" id="link-id111e26f8" name=
"link-id111e26f8">WordPress</a>, and <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/MediaWiki" id="link-id10ea0258" name=
"link-id10ea0258">MediaWiki</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, to the RDF Linked Data deployment, we've also taken
the traditional LAMP installation tedium out of the typical PHP
application deployment process. For instance, you don't have to
rebuild PHP 3.5 (32 or 64 Bit) on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux to
get going, simply install Virtuoso, and then select a VAD package
for the relevant application and you're set. If the application of
choice isn't pre packaged by us, simply install as you would when
using Apache, which comes dow to situating the PHP files in your
Web structure under the Web Application's root directory.</p>
<h3>Installation Guide</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the Virtuoso installer for Windows (<a href=

<li>Run the installer (or download the movies using the links in
the related section below)</li>
<li>Go to the Virtuoso Conductor (*which will show up at the end of
the installation process* or go to
http://localhost:8890/conductor)</li>
<li>Go to the "Admin" tab within the (X)HTML based UI and select
the "Packages" sub-menu item (a Tab)</li>
<li>Pick phpBB3 (or any other pre-packaged PHP app) and then click
on "Install/Upgrase"</li>
<li>The watch one of my silent movies or read the initial startup
guides for Virtuoso hosted phpBB3, Drupal, Wordpress,
MediaWiki.</li>

<p>At the current time, I've only provided links to ZIP files
containing the Virtuoso installation "silent movies". This approach
is a short-term solution to some of my current movie publishing
challenges re. YouTube and Vimeo -- where the compressed output
hasn't been of acceptable visual quality. Once resolved, I will
publish much more "Multimedia Web" friendly movies :-)</p>

id="link-id110d44a8" name="link-id110d44a8">Sören Auer</a> asked me
to say a few things about relational to <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Resource_Description_Framework" id=
"link-id0x2859e3e0" name="link-id0x2859e3e0">RDF</a> mapping. I
will cite some highlights from this, as they pertain to the general
scene. There was an "open hacking" session Wednesday night
featuring lightning talks. I will use some of these too as a
starting point.</p>
<h3>The messaging?</h3>
<p>The SWEO (Semantic Web Education and Outreach) interest group of
the W3C spent some time looking for an elevator pitch for the
Semantic Web. It became "<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Data"
id="link-id0x29f6f520" name="link-id0x29f6f520">Data</a>
Unleashed." Why not? Let's give this some context.</p>
<p>So, if we are holding a <i>Semantic Web 101</i> session, where
should we begin? I hazard to guess that we should not begin by
writing a FOAF file in Turtle by hand, as this is one thing that is
not likely to happen in the real world.</p>

<p>Of course, the social aspect of the Data Web is the most
immediately engaging, so a demo might be to go make an account with
<a href="http://myopenlink.net/" id="link-id111ab8c8" name=
"link-id111ab8c8">myopenlink.net</a> and see that after one has
entered the data one normally enters for any social network, one
has become a Data Web citizen. This means that one can be found,
just like this, with a query against the set of data spaces hosted
on the system. Then we just need a few pages that repurpose this
data and relate it to other data. We show some samples of queries
like this in our <a href="http://challenge.semanticweb.org/" id=
"link-id0x29685a60" name="link-id0x29685a60">Billion Triples
Challenge</a> demo. We will make a webcast about this to make it
all clearer.</p>
<p>Behold: The Data Web is about the world becoming a database;
writing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SPARQL" id=
"link-id0x27ec0020" name="link-id0x27ec0020">SPARQL</a> queries or
triples is incidental. You will write FOAF files by hand just as
little as you now write <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SQL"
id="link-id0x2822d358" name="link-id0x2822d358">SQL</a> insert
statements for filling in your account <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Information" id="link-id0x288d1ff0"
name="link-id0x288d1ff0">information</a> on Myspace.</p>

<p>Every time there is a major shift in technology, this shift
needs to be motivated by addressing a new class of problem. This
means doing something that could not be done before. The last time
this happened was when the relational database became the dominant
IT technology. At that time, the questions involved putting the
enterprise in the database and building a cluster of Line Of
Business (LOB) applications around the database. The argument for
the <a href=
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relational_database_management_system"
id="link-id0x27e07288" name="link-id0x27e07288">RDBMS</a> was that
you did not have to constrain the set of queries that might later
be made, when designing the database. In other words, it was making
things more <i>ad hoc</i>. This was opposed then on grounds of
being less efficient than the hierarchical and network databases
which the relational eventually replaced.</p>
<p>Today, the point of the Data Web is that you do not have to
constrain what your data can join or integrate with, when you
design your database. The counter-argument is that this is slow and
geeky and not scalable. See the similarity?</p>
<p>A difference is that we are not specifically aiming at replacing
the RDBMS. In fact, if you know exactly what you will query and
have a well defined workload, a relational representation optimized
for the workload will give you about 10x the performance of the
equivalent RDF warehouse. OLTP remains a relational-only
domain.</p>
<p>However, when we are talking about doing queries and analytics
against the Web, or even against more than a handful of relational
systems, the things which make RDBMS good become problematic.</p>
<h3>What is the business value of this?</h3>
<p>The most reliable of human drives is the drive to make oneself
known. This drives all, from any social scene to business
communications to politics. Today, when you want to proclaim you
exist, you do so first on the Web. The Web did not become the
prevalent media because business loved it for its own sake, it
became prevalent because business could not afford not to assert
their presence there. If anything, the Web eroded the
communications dominance of a lot of players, which was not welcome
but still had to be dealt with, by embracing the Web.</p>

<p>Today, in a world driven by data, the Data Web will be catalyzed
by similar factors: If your data is not there, you will not figure
in query results. Search engines will play some role there but also
many social applications will have reports that are driven by
published data. Also consider any e-commerce, any marketplace, and
so forth. The Data Portability movement is a case in point: Users
want to own their own content; silo operators want to capitalize on
holding it. Right now, we see these things in silos; the Data Web
will create bridges between these, and what is now in silo data
centers will be increasingly available on an ad hoc basis with Open
Data.</p>
<p>Again, we see a movement from the specialized to the generic:
What LinkedIn does in its data center can be done with ad hoc
queries with <a href=
"http://community.linkeddata.org/dataspace/organization/lod#this"
id="link-id0x27a39960" name="link-id0x27a39960">linked open
data</a>. Of course, LinkedIn does these things somewhat more
efficiently because their system is built just for this task, but
the linked data approach has the built-in readiness to join with
everything else at almost no cost, without making a new data
warehouse for each new business question.</p>
<p>We could call this the sociological aspect of the thing. Getting
to more concrete business, we see an economy that, we could say,
without being alarmists, is confronted with some issues. Well,
generally when times are bad, this results in consolidation of
property and power. Businesses fail and get split up and sold off
in pieces, government adds controls and regulations and so forth.
This means ad hoc data integration, as control without data is just
pretense. If times are lean, this also means that there is little
readiness to do wholesale replacement of systems, which will take
years before producing anything. So we must play with what there is
and make it deliver, in ways and conditions that were not
necessarily anticipated. The agility of the Data Web, if correctly
understood, can be of great benefit there, especially on the
reporting and business intelligence side. Specifically mapping
line-of-business systems into RDF on the fly will help with
integration, making the specialized warehouse the slower and more
expensive alternative. But this too is needed at times.</p>
<p>But for the RDF community to be taken seriously there, the
messaging must be geared in this direction. Writing FOAF files by
hand is not where you begin the pitch. Well, what is more natural
then having a global, queriable information space, when you have a
global information driven economy?</p>
<p>The Data Web is about making this happen. First with doing this
in published generally available data; next with the enterprises
having their private data for their own use but still linking
toward the outside, even though private data stays private: You can
still use standard terms and taxonomies, where they apply, when
talking of proprietary information.</p>
<h3>But let's get back to more specific issues</h3>
<p>At the lightning talks in Vienna, one participant said, "Man's
enemy is not the lion that eats men, it's his own brother. Semantic
Web's enemy is the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/XML" id=
"link-id0x282c8e90" name="link-id0x282c8e90">XML</a> Web services
stack that ate its lunch." There is some truth to the first part.
The second part deserves some comment. The Web services stack is
about transactions. When you have a fixed, often repeating task, it
is a natural thing to make this a Web service. Even though SOA is
not really prevalent in enterprise IT, it has value in things like
managing supply-chain logistics with partners, etc. Lots of
standard messages with unambiguous meaning. To make a parallel with
the database world: first there was OLTP; then there was business
intelligence. Of course, you must first have the transactions, to
have something to analyze.</p>

<p>SOA is for the transactions; the Data Web is for integration,
analysis, and discovery. It is the <i>ad hoc</i> component of the
real time enterprise, if you will. It is not a competitor against a
transaction oriented SOA. In fact, RDF has no special genius for
transactions. Another mistake that often gets made is stretching
things beyond their natural niche. Doing transactions in RDF is
this sort of over-stretching without real benefit.</p>
<p>"I made an ontology and it really did solve a problem. How do I
convince the enterprise people, the MBA who says it's too complex,
the developer who says it is not what he's used to, and so on?"</p>
<p>This is an education question. One of the findings of SWEO's
enterprise survey was that there was awareness that difficult
problems existed. There were and are corporate ontologies and
taxonomies, diversely implemented. Some of these needs are
recognized. RDF based technologies offer to make these more open
standards based. open standards have proven economical in the past.
What we also hear is that major enterprises do not even know what
their information and human resources assets are: Experts can't be
found even when they are in the next department, or reports and
analysis gets buried in wikis, spreadsheets, and emails.</p>
<p>Just as when SQL took off, we need vendors to do workshops on
getting started with a technology. The affair in Vienna was a step
in this direction. Another type of event specially focusing on
vertical problems and their Data Web solutions is a next step. For
example, one could do a workshop on integrating supply chain
information with Data Web technologies. Or one on making enterprise
<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knowledge" id=
"link-id0x287785f0" name="link-id0x287785f0">knowledge</a> bases
from HR, CRM, office automation, wikis, etc. The good thing is that
all these things are additions to, not replacements of, the
existing mission-critical infrastructure. And better use of what
you already have ought to be the theme of the day.</p>

me the Web of Data is coming on ok too.</p>
<p>I only just got to see Andreas´Brian May guitar (red thing). But
the freee beer worked as well.</p>
<p>I managed to panic Michael, but as a conference organiser he did
a grand job.</p>
<p>I got away without slides, pacing up and down and ranting was
ok.</p>
<p>Keith was trying to coordinate me, but, erm, hiding to
nothing.</p>
<p>&#160;So I´ve got the weekend in Vienna before going to
Karlsruhe. Hope the ontologists aren’t too scary.</p>

recent discussion of what makes an API RESTful</a>. If you've not
read the post and all the comments then I encourage you to do so:
there's some great tidbits in there that have certainly given me
pause for thought.</p>
<p>The following attempts to illustrate my understanding of REST.
Perhaps bizarrely, I've chosen to focus more on the client than on
the design of the server, e.g. what resources it exposes, etc. This
is because I don't think enough focus has been placed on the
client, particularly when it comes to the hypermedia constraint.
And I think that often, when we focus on how to design an "API",
we're glossing over some important aspects of the REST architecture
which includes after all, other types of actors, including both
clients and intermediaries.</p>
<p>I've also deliberately chosen not to draw much on existing
specifications, again its too easy to muddy the waters with
irrelevant details.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm well prepared to stand corrected on any or all of
the below. Will be interested to hear if anyone has any
comments.</p>
<p>Lets imagine there are two mime types.</p>
<p>The first is called <code>application/x-wiki-description</code>.
It define a JSON format that describes the basic structure of a
Wiki website. The format includes a mixture of simple data items,
URIs and URI templates that collectively describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the wiki</li>

<li>the email address of the administrator</li>
<li>a link to the Recent Changes resource</li>
<li>a link to the Main page</li>
<li>a link to the license statement</li>
<li>a link to the search page (as a URI template, that may include
a search term)</li>
<li>a link to parameterized RSS feed (as a URI template that may
include a date)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another mime type is
<code>application/x-wiki-page-versions</code>. This is another JSON
based format that describes the version history of a wiki page. The
format is an ordered collection of links. Each resource in that
list is a prior version of the wiki page; the most recent page is
first in the list.</p>

<p>Spam-E is a little web robot that has been programmed with the
smarts to understand several mime types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>application/x-wiki-description</code></li>
<li><code>application/x-wiki-page-versions</code></li>
<li>RSS and Atom</li>
<li>XHTML</li>
</ul>
<p>Spam-E also understands a profile of XHTML that defines two
elements: one that points to a resource capable of serving wiki
descriptions, another that points to a resource that can return
wiki page version descriptions..</p>
<p>Spam-E has internal logic that has been designed to detect SPAM
in XHTML pages. It also has a fully functioning HTTP client. And it
also has been programmed with logic appropriate to processing those
specific media types.</p>
<p>Initially, when starting Spam-E does nothing. It waits to
receive a link, e.g. via a simple user interface. Its in a steady
state waiting for input.</p>

<p>Spam-E then receives a link. The robot immediates dereferences
the link. It does so by submitting a GET request to the URL, and
includes an Accept header:</p>
<p><code><br />
Accept: x-wiki/description;q=1.0, x-wiki/page-versions;q=0.9,
application/xhtml+xml;q=0.8, application/atom+xml;q=0.5,
application/rss+xml;q=0.4<br /></code></p>
<p>This clearly states Spam-E's preference to receive specific
mime-types.</p>
<p>In this instance is receives an XHTML document in return. Not
ideal, but Spam-E knows how to handle it. After parsing it, it
turns out that this is not a specific profile of XHTML that Spam-E
understands, so it simply extract all the anchor elements from the
file and uses it to widen its search for wiki spam. Another way to
say this is that Spam-E has changed its status to one of searching.
This state transition has been triggered by following a link,
receiving and processing a specific mimetype. This is "hypermedia
as the engine of application state" in action.</p>
<p>Spam-E performs this deference-parse-traverse operation several
times before finding an XHTML document that conforms to the profile
it understands. The document contains a link to a resource that
should be capable of serving a wiki description representation.</p>
<p>Spam-E is now in discovery mode. Spam-E uses an Accept header of
<code>application/x-wiki-description</code> when following the link
and is returned a matching representation. Spam-E parses the JSON
and now has additional information at its disposal: it knows how to
search the wiki, how to find the RSS feed, how to contact the wiki
administrator, etc.</p>
<p>Spam-E now enters Spam Detection mode. It requests, with a
suitable Accept header, the recent changes resource, stating a
preference for Atom documents. It instead gets an RSS feed, but
thats fine because Spam-E still knows how to process that. For each
entry in the feed, Spam-E requests the wiki page, using an Accept
header of <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>

<p>Spam-E now tries to find if there is spam on the page by
applying its local spam detection logic. In this instance Spam-E
discovers some spam on the page. It checks the XHTML document it
was returned and discovers that it conforms to a known profile and
that embedded in a link element is a reference to the "versions"
resource. Spam-E dereferences this link using an Accept header of
<code>application/x-wiki-page-versions</code>.</p>
<p>Spam-E, who is now in Spam Cleaning mode, fetches each version
in turn and performs spam detection on it. If spam is found, then
Spam-E performs a <code>DELETE</code> request on the URI. This will
remove that version of the wiki page from the wiki. Someone
browsing the original URI of the page will now see an earlier, spam
free version.</p>
<p>Once it has finished its cycle of spam detection and cleaning,
Spam-E reverts to search mode until it runs out of new URIs.</p>
<p>There are several important points to underline here:</p>
<p>Firstly, at no point did the authors of Spam-E have to have any
prior knowledge about the URL structure of any site that the robot
might visit. All that Spam-E was programmed with was logic relating
to some defined media types (or extension points of a media type in
the case of the XHTML profiles) and the basic semantics of
HTTP.</p>
<p>Secondly, no one had to publish any service description
documents, or define any API end points. No one had to define what
operations could be carried out on specific resources, or what
response codes would be returned. All information was found by
traversing links and by following the semantics of HTTP.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Spam-E application basically went through a series
of state transitions triggered by what media types it received when
requesting certain URIs. The application is basically a simple
state machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully that is a useful example. Again, I'm very
happy to take feedback. Comments are disabled on this blog, but
feel free to drop me a mail (see the Feedback link).</p>

<p>The Web of Data Practitioners Days concluded with the session on
<a href="http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session6">Multimedia in
the Web of Data</a>, the first part of which was led by <a href=
"http://www.uni-koblenz.de/FB4/Institutes/IFI/AGStaab/People/Ansgar%20Scherp">
Ansgar Scherp</a> (<a href="http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/"
title="University of Koblenz and Landau" rel="homepage" class=
"zem_slink">University of Koblenz-Landau</a>, Germany).</p>
<p>Multimedia content, as Ansgar pointed out, is hardly annotated,
badly organized, and hardly ever looked at again - just think of
the 300 something pics you might take on an average week-end
getaway, and which you never touch again. Annotating multimedia
content requires a lot of work and dedication - but most of the
time, these pictures eventually dissappear in the “digital shoe
box” that is your photo management software.</p>

<p>The most obvious remedy is to annotate content as early as
possible, ideally when creating the content, ideally already on
your portable camera (formerly known as: mobile phone:) Ansgar
suggested to provide incentives for people to encourage picture
annotation - professionals could for instance receive a higher
financial reward if the deliver already annotated pictures. And of
course there are ‘Games with a purpose’ such as <a href=
"http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google Image Labeler</a>,
where players tag images in pairs, with and against each other, and
are rewarded with the entertainment factor of the game.</p>
<p>The slide below shows what has happened (or will happen) to the
process of creating photo books in the digital age and the age of
mashups:</p>
<p><img src=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/_talkansgarscherp.jpg"
alt="Ansgar Scherp's slides" title="Ansgar Scherp\'s slides" class=
"alignnone size-full wp-image-326" height="370" width="500" /></p>
<p>After all, this is the age of the social semantic web, so why
not try and (re-)use the content, structure and contexts that other
users have already created on the web? <strong>Content
augmentation</strong>, for the scope that Ansgar is concerned with,
consists in the reuse of content and structures (e.g. from sources
such as Flickr and Wikipedia, Geonames) made possible through the
definition of rules, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are two or less pictures on a page*</li>
<li>then automatically augment the page with additional photos
using location information.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Page here means a page in the album you are currently working
on - you probably took a picture of yourself and your friend in
Paris, and even though you went to the <a href=
"http://www.centrepompidou.fr/" title="Centre Georges Pompidou"
rel="homepage" class="zem_slink">Centre Pompidou</a>, you forgot to
actually take a pic of the building itself - well, let the web be
your library!</p>
<p>So the goal is clear: develop a procedure for applying automatic
content augmentation in the creation of good photo books.</p>
<p>But what makes a ‘good’ photo book anyway? Here are some of the
results of a structural analysis of real, human-created photobooks
conducted at <a href="http://www.cewecolor.de/">CeWe Color</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>% of photos with faces: 36%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of album pages: 16.96</strong></li>
<li><strong>Photos per page: 6.69</strong></li>

<li><strong>Text fields per page: 1.45</strong></li>
<li><strong>% of pages with text: 87%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many rules that can be established from the structural
analysis, which can be applied in turn in the creation of
photoboooks, e.g. rules like this one,</p>
<ul>
<li>If the text located in the upper third of a page</li>
<li>if the font size is equal or larger that 16 points</li>
<li>if the number of words is less than 10</li>
<li>if there is no caption on the page that has a bigger font
size</li>
<li>then this page is the title</li>

</ul>
<p>Ansgar recommended <a href=
"http://www.delos.info/index.php?Itemid=297&amp;id=556&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view">
xSmart</a>, which he described as a “context-driven authoring tool
for page-based multimedia presentations.”</p>
<p>Ansgar’s presentation was followed by two more: one by Yves
Raimond on Interlinking Music on the Web of Data, and one on
Interlinking Multimedia - in spite of better intentions, I did not
manage to cover these two in detail, but at least I gathered the
links to relevant resources from all three sessions…<span id=

<p>Last not least: Ansgar Scherp allowed us a sneak peek of
SemaPlorer, a Large-scale Semantic Faceted Browsing Application for
Multimedia Data that is going to be revealed on Dec 2, 2008, at the
<a href="http://www.boemie.org/">BOEMIE Bootstrapping Ontology
Evolution with Multimedia Information Extraction) workshop</a> in
Koblenz. Here is an abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigating large media repositories is a tedious task, because
it requires frequent search for the `right’ keywords, as searching
and browsing do not consider the semantics of multimedia data. To
resolve this issue, we have developed the SemaPlorer application.
SemaPlorer facilitates easy usage of Flickr data by allowing for
faceted browsing taking into account semantic background knowledge
harvested from sources such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org" title=
"DBpedia" rel="homepage" class="zem_slink">DBpedia</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames" title="GeoNames" rel=
"wikipedia" class="zem_slink">GeoNames</a>, WordNet and personal
FOAF files. The inclusion of such background knowledge, however,
puts a heavy load on the repository infrastructure that cannot be
handled by off-the-shelf software. Therefore, we have developed
SemaPlorer’s storage infrastructure based on Amazon’s Elastic
Computing Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service. We apply
NetworkedGraphs as additional layer on top of EC2, performing as a
large, federated data infrastructure for semantically heterogeneous
data sources from within and outside of the cloud. Therefore,
SemaPlorer is scalable with respect to the amount of distributed
components working together as well as the number of triples
managed overall.<br />

<p>This <a href=
"http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session4">morning’s first
session</a> was dedicated to <a href=
"http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session4%20">Using the Web of
Data</a>, or, as <a href="http://www.alandix.com/blog/">Alan
Dix</a> put it: “In the end, it’s not about data - it’s about use!”
Alan and <a href="http://dowhatimean.net/">Richard Cyganiak</a>

were the keynoters for this session.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/%7Edixa/">Alan Dix</a> is a
Professor at the Computing Department of <a href=
"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=54.0102777778,-2.78555555556&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=54.0102777778,-2.78555555556%20%28Lancaster%20University%29&amp;t=h"
title="Lancaster University" rel="geolocation" class=
"zem_slink">Lancaster University</a>, and author (with Janet
Finlay, Gregory Abowd, and Russel Beale) of <a href=
"http://www.hcibook.com/e3/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>.</p>
<p>To start with, Alan pointed to the two sides of achieving the
web of data: Firstly generating the web of data (<a href=
"http://challenge.semanticweb.org/">a billion triples</a>, as
mighty as this may sound, is actually tiny, says Alan) and then,
secondly, accessing the web of data.</p>
<p><a href=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/_talkalandix.jpg">
<img src=

alt="Alan Dix giving a talk" title="Alan Dix giving a talk" class=
"alignnone size-full wp-image-324" height="428" width=
"500" /></a></p>
<p>With regard to generating the Web of Data, Alan distinguished
between top down and bottom up approaches, counting to the former
the creation of the web of data from legacy sources (i.e. where you
take existing data and semantically lift them, e.g. from structured
data) or web scraping such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org" title=
"DBpedia" rel="homepage" class="zem_slink">DBpedia</a>’s extraction
of data from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>N.B.: This notion of ‘top-down’ does not imply a hierarchical
relationship, but rather means that there is already a plan for
what is going to be put on the web of data (e.g. ‘all
semi-structured information on Wikipedia’ or ‘dataset XY from
project Z’). The bottom-up idea here implies that data is added as
the result of an action, or interaction, as the user/s go, e.g.
relationships are created as the user expands his or her social
network. For instance on Amazon, user interaction is used to
generate semantics: People do not tell Amazon what they like, they
simply buy it.</p>
<p>Having relationships of course does not imply yet that these
relationships are part of the Semantic Web. Or, as Alan put it,
“why should I be RDFizing my online presence if none of my friends
are?”</p>
<p>Please take a look at the <a href=
"http://www.hcibook.com/alan/papers/WOD-PD-2008/wod-talk-v7.pdf">PDF
of the Alan’s slides</a> (2,4 MB) - what I cannot reproduce here is
a chart he developed, which was very useful for describing current
scenarios on the web and which posed a twofold question:</p>
<p>Does a website/platform have the web of data implemented?
YES/NO<br />
Is the web of data on ta website/platform apparent to the user?
YES/NO</p>
<p>The possible combinations (YES/YES, YES/NO, NO/YES, NO/NO)
provide a good heuristic tool for describing what is currently
available, with and without the Semantic Web. Take, for instance,
the shiny interface of Talis’ <a href=
"http://cenote.talis.com/">Project Cenote</a>: Cenote’s vision is
to “make library data visible in many contexts, inside and outside
of the library, making the data much more accessible and visible to
a wider audience - benefiting current and potential users of
library services wherever they are.” On Cenote, the user doesn’t
see that it’s got the Web of Dat in it - it is actually
implemented, but not in a way that is apparent to the user.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have a platform like
Facebook: Alan referred to Facebook as “the user’s own web of
data”, i.e. web of relationships: The user is aware of these
relationships (they actually shape his interaction and
communication with the site), and the (numerous!) <a href=
"http://developers.facebook.com/">apps on Facebook</a> continually
add relationships, but, regrettably, insulated from one another and
not using RDF (and <a href=
"http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/03/ive-been-kicked-off-of-facebook/">
don’t you try to take data out of Facebook</a>!).</p>
<p>Two examples of public data that Alan cited and that grow as
people/institutions add data do them are <a href=
"http://www.freebase.com">Freebase</a> (the “open database of the
world’s information” - see <a href=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/tag/freebase/">previous posts on this
blog about Freebase</a>) and <a href=
"http://www.swivel.com/">Swivel</a>. Swivel allows people,
institutions, anyone to upload and explore data, also featuring
official data sources such as (links go to their Swivel pages):
<a href="http://www.swivel.com/users/show/1006407">New York Federal
Reserve Bank</a>, <a href=
"http://www.swivel.com/users/show/1005269">UNESCO Institute for
Statistics</a>, <a href=
"http://www.swivel.com/users/show/1007675">DukeResearch</a> or

<a href="http://www.swivel.com/users/show/1005752">EUROSTAT</a>.
According to Alan, there is already more data on Swivel now than in
the whole Linked Data cloud.</p>
<p>Alan also mentioned the <a href=
"http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph API</a> - o
yesterday evening <a href="http://www.2-blog.net/">Luca Hammer</a>
(one of the web 2.0 people who had joined the Open Hacking Session)
introduced me to the Wordpress Plugin “<a href=
"http://www.berriart.com/meet-your-commenters">Meet your
commenters</a>” - Meet you commenters uses Social Graph to find
social relations on the web, and adds these data to the commenter
profiles it creates in Wordpress.</p>

a different note: I took sometime today to explore <a href=
"http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/%7Edixa/">Alan’s homepage</a> and
found the cute <a href=
"http://www.vfridge.com/crackers/g/x">Christmas Cracker’s
application</a> which was first developed in 1999 and which is now
also <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/crackers/">available on
Facebook</a>. As trivial as it may sound at first - sending virtual
Christmas Crackers (with more than 5000 possible combinations!) is
a good showcase for developing Human Interaction Scenarios, and a
number of papers have been written about the application. Here is
the casestudy which Alan recommends to begin with: <a href=
"http://www.hcibook.com/e3/casestudy/crackers">Designing experience
- virtual Christmas Crackers.</a></p>

<p>The abstract and a list of links to all websites and demos Alan
discussed <a href=
"http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/%7Edixa/papers/WOD-PD-2008/">can be
found here</a>. Full reference: A. Dix and R. Cyganiak (2008).

<p>Even if you have not met <a href=
"http://dowhatimean.net/">Richard Cyganiak</a> in person, you have
certainly come across one of his creations: The <a href=
"http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/">Linked Data Cloud</a>.
Richard is a <a href=
"http://www.deri.ie/about/team/member/richard_cyganiak/">research
assistant at DERI Galway</a>. In his demo, he gave us the
opportunity to gain hands on experience, introducing a tool he
dubbed <a href="http://dowhatimean.net/wod-pd/">Snorql</a>, which
is basically an easier to use version of a SPARQL-endpoint, as it
already has the required prefixes ‘pre-installed’:</p>
<p><img src=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/snorql.gif"
alt="" title="Snorql - simple SPARQL endpoint" class=
"alignnone size-full wp-image-323" height="360" width="500" /></p>

<p>Using the Snorql interface, we could explore the dataset we had
created collaboratively during <a href=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/2008/10/22/web-of-data-practitioners-days-1st-session-tweaking-turtles/">
Keith Alexander and Yves Raimond’s session</a>. Writing SPARQL
queries manually can be a challenge, but is next to impossible if
you (like me) don’t know the syntax. But today we could just copy
and paste all the queries from <a href=
"http://dowhatimean.net/wod-pd/using.html">a website Richard had
put up prior to his session</a> - thanks a lot for the excellent
preparation and demonstration!</p>
<p>Richard also showed a couple of RDF browsers in action, e.g. the
<a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2007/tab/">Tabulator Plugin</a>
(”a Firefox extension which allows Firefox to handle data as well
as documents”), or the Marbles Linked Data browser which is running
right on <a href="http://beckr.org/marbles">beckr.org/marbles</a>;
enter, for instance
<code>http://api.talis.com/stores/wod-pd-sandbox/items/People/JanaHerwig</code>
(learn <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Marbles">more about Marbles
here</a>).</p>

<p>Thank you, Alan and Richard - the combination of talk and demo
was indeed a perfect intro towards using the Web of Data.<br /></p>

  <description>The third session at WOD-PD was dedicated to “ Bringing (Legacy) Data on the Web “, and led by Sören Auer (University of Leipzig, Germany) and Orri Erling (OpenLink Software) . Sören Auer described the difference between the Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 as follows: On the Web 1.0, you had many websites that provided unstructured, mainly textual content. On the Web 2.0, you have a few large websites that are specialised on specific content types.

the difference between the Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 as follows: On the
Web 1.0, you had many websites that provided unstructured, mainly
textual content. On the Web 2.0, you have a few large websites that
are specialised on specific content types. And, finally, on the Web
3.0, there are many websites which contain, and are able to
semantically syndicate, arbitrarily structured content.</p>
<p>So why would we need another web? What you cannot do with the
current web is finding answers to seemingly complex, yet in reality
pretty mundane question such as: Where in Leipzig do I find an
apartment that is close to bilingual, German-French child care
facilities? Are there any ERP service providers which have offices
in Vienna and Berlin? Who are the researchers in South-East Asia
currently working on database related topics?</p>
<p>Sören further discussed three of the present means of bringing
relation data to the web: <a href=
"http://triplify.org">Triplify</a> (a web application plugin that
exposes data from relational databases in RDF), <a href=
"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/d2rq/">D2RQ</a> (a
declarative language to describe mappings between relational
database schemata and OWL/RDFS ontologies, developed at Free
University Berlin), and <a href=
"http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/">Virtuoso Universal Server</a> (a
middleware and database engine hybrid delivering for instance data
integration for SQL, RDF, XML, Web Services). With respect to
Triplify, Sören - who is Triplify’s founder and main developer at
<a href="http://aksw.org/">AKSW</a> Uni Leipzig - showed and
discussed the configuration for Wordpress 2.1., <a href=
"http://triplify.org/Configuration/WordPress?v=49d">which can be
found here</a> (<a href=
"http://triplify.org/Configuration?v=s2s">click here for more
configurations</a>, e.g. for Joomla, OpenConf and Drupal). The next
aim for Triplify is to become an integral part in enduser web app
distibutions.</p>

<p>And important question raised by Sören was: How do next
generation search engines know that something has changed on the
web of data? He suggested three approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always try to crawl everything (this may sound silly - but
that’s actually what is happening on the current web)</li>
<li>Ping a central update notification service - e.g. <a href=
"http://www.pingthesemanticweb.com/">PingTheSemanticWeb.com</a> -

<p>Orri Erling, as the lead developer of the Virtuoso Team,
addressed the issue of mapping relational databases to RDF with
OpenLink Virtuoso. In his talk, he addressed the pros and cons of
RDF data warehouse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Even query performance across all data</li>
<li>Possibility of forward-chaining inference</li>
<li>Some SPARQL features may be better supported, e.g. Unspecified

</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping data up-to-date</li>

<li>Complex set up, needs dedicated servers: you don’t build them
on a whim</li>

<p>The <a href="http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session3">third
session at WOD-PD</a> was dedicated to “<a href=
"http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session3">Bringing (Legacy) Data
on the Web</a>“, and led by <a href=
"http://aksw.org/SoerenAuer">Sören Auer</a> (University of Leipzig,
Germany) and <a href=
"http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/">Orri Erling</a>
(OpenLink Software) .</p>
<p><a href=
"http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/_talksoerenauer.jpg">

alt="Sören Auer giving a talk" title="Sören Auer giving a talk"
align="right" height="246" width="239" /></a>Sören Auer described
the difference between the Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 as follows: On the
Web 1.0, you had many websites that provided unstructured, mainly
textual content. On the Web 2.0, you have a few large websites that
are specialised on specific content types. And, finally, on the Web
3.0, there are many websites which contain, and are able to
semantically syndicate, arbitrarily structured content.</p>
<p>So why would we need another web? What you cannot do with the
current web is finding answers to seemingly complex, yet in reality
pretty mundane question such as: Where in Leipzig do I find an
apartment that is close to bilingual, German-French child care
facilities? Are there any ERP service providers which have offices
in Vienna and Berlin? Who are the researchers in South-East Asia
currently working on database related topics?</p>
<p>Sören further discussed three of the present means of bringing
relation data to the web: <a href=
"http://triplify.org">Triplify</a> (a web application plugin that
exposes data from relational databases in RDF), <a href=
"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/d2rq/">D2RQ</a> (a
declarative language to describe mappings between relational
database schemata and OWL/RDFS ontologies, developed at Free
University Berlin), and <a href=
"http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/">Virtuoso Universal Server</a> (a
middleware and database engine hybrid delivering for instance data
integration for SQL, RDF, XML, Web Services). With respect to
Triplify, Sören - who is Triplify’s founder and main developer at
<a href="http://aksw.org/">AKSW</a> Uni Leipzig - showed and
discussed the configuration for Wordpress 2.1., <a href=
"http://triplify.org/Configuration/WordPress?v=49d">which can be
found here</a> (<a href=
"http://triplify.org/Configuration?v=s2s">click here for more
configurations</a>, e.g. for Joomla, OpenConf and Drupal). The next
aim for Triplify is to become an integral part in enduser web app
distibutions.</p>
<p>And important question raised by Sören was: How do next
generation search engines know that something has changed on the
web of data? He suggested three approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always try to crawl everything (this may sound silly - but
that’s actually what is happening on the current web)</li>
<li>Ping a central update notification service - e.g. <a href=
"http://www.pingthesemanticweb.com/">PingTheSemanticWeb.com</a> -
which works as a showcase, but will probably not scale if the data
web gets really deployed.</li>
<li>Each linked data endpoint publishes an update log - e.g. with
Triplify, as a special folder inside the Triplify namespace, e.g.
http://example.com/Triplify/update</li>
</ol>

Leo introduced the idea of the Semantic Desktop, and more specifically, the Nepomuk Social Semantic Desktop .

Desktop,</a> and more specifically, the <a href=
"http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/">Nepomuk Social Semantic
Desktop</a>. There’s good article about <a href=
"http://www.linux.com/feature/144853">Nepomuk on Linux.com</a>,
written by Bruce Byfield on August 26, 2008, from which I quote the
following, enlightening passages:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ansgar Bernardi, deputy head of the Knowledge Management
Department at Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche
Intelligenz (DFKI, or the German Research Center for Artificial
Intelligence) and Nepomuk’s coordinator, explains, “The basic
problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of
information at a sensible rate.” [...] “The point is, you have a
vast amount of information on your desktop, hidden in files, hidden
in emails, hidden in the names and structures of your folders.
Nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information.”</p>
<p>At a high level of generalization, Nepomuk has three main
aspects, according to Bernardi. First, there is a standard
framework for annotating pieces of information so that connections
can be made between them. Second, there are ontologies, the sets of
“documented shared understanding” or common concepts that can be
defined for particular types of information, such as bio-science or
computer desktop use. Finally, there are the tools for making or
using the annotations and ontologies, what Bernardi calls the
“workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your
day to day activities of collecting information, structuring it,
making sense of it, and creating new information and communicating
it.”</p>

<p><a href=

as computational methods for processing and manipulating language
(for instance text analysis).</p>

that <strong>by saying</strong> something, one actually

<strong>does</strong> something. For instance, the sentence “Please
have the document ready for Workshop 1.” contains an instruction:
It informs the reader about the requirements for a particular

some fun formalizing the notion of ’surprise’, i.e. an unexpected

<p>Another interesting development is the plan hatched by Dan

"http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/drafts/soccharter.html">Social
Web Incubator group</a> within the W3C.&#160; Hopefully this will
take on the issue of representation, since other initiatives with
social and open in their names tended to focus on APIs and the
technical interoperability of applications. To kickstart all this,
the W3C is organizing a <a href=

semantic technologies, social network analysis and visualization,
and proving social theories using social network data. The book is
based on my PhD thesis, and although it has been out for a year, it

<p>Good morning from Vienna:) <a href="http://webofdata.info">The
Web of Data Practitioners Days</a> really kicked off with a bang
today - with <a href="http://sw-app.org/mic.xhtml">Michael
Hausenblas</a> doing a strip! Only to expose the Semantic Web
t-shirt he wore underneath his smart suit and tie, of course, but
he really got the attention of attendees at 9:15 in the

<p>First session - <a href=
"http://webofdata.info/sessions/#session1">Web of Data 101</a> by
<a href="http://moustaki.org/">Yves Raimond</a> and <a href=
"http://kwijibo.talis.com">Keith Alexander</a> - explained the
implications of the move from a Web of Documents to a Web of Data:
With the Semantic Web architecture, data can be made explicit on
the web. Data here means not only data contained in documents, but
data describing persons, cities, bands, events, finally arriving at
the “Web of Things” (see also this <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0926-dsr-WDC/slides.pdf">presentation
by Dave Raggett</a>, W3C, - PDF 2,7 MB). The Web of Data wouldn’t
be a Web if the data weren’t interlinked - here is an overview of
the principles of Linked Data:</p>

<ul>
<li>always use <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>
as names for things</li>
<li>more specifically, use <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Technical_view">
HTTP URIs</a> so that people can look up those names on the
web</li>
<li>when someone looks up an URI, provide useful RDF information
(<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>
is the data model used for data on the web of data)</li>

<li>include RDF statements that link to other URI (otherwise it
wouldn’t be a web).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also watch out for what is already happening and is going
to happen in the future on <a href=
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/beta">www.bbc.co.uk/music/beta</a>.

didn’t manage to produce a piece of valid code in N3 right away
(i.e. not valid according to <a href=
"http://www.rdfabout.com/demo/validator">this validator</a>). It
only worked after I had removed the statements about who I know or
what I am interested in - without these connections, what remains

  <title>Videos: Anzo for Excel in action</title>
  <description>Ever since we first showed Anzo for Excel at SemTech in May, we've had a blast talking with tons of people and discussing how a semantics-based approach to Excel might address many longstanding spreadsheet challenges facing organizations big and small alike. The technology continues to improve dramatically from week to week, and we're looking forward to a first general release of a productized Anzo for Excel at the end of this year. We've recently put together a short (5 min.) video showing many of the capabilities of Anzo for Excel in the context of an ad-hoc project planning scenario: Anzo ...</description>

<p>Two slightly other-side points which came to mind, though.

who’ve done interesting things make the best news, I guess!).

<p>I’ve been out of the Talis office for nearly two weeks—the last
of which was on holiday without internet connection of any
description. The week before that, however, I spent at <a href=

FOWA</a> (Future Of Web Apps) in London. Aside from being really
good fun, the conference had a bunch of brilliant speakers and an
interesting range of topics covered. I followed the business track,
which focused on startups, entreprenurial aspects of the tech
space, and related areas. (<a href=
